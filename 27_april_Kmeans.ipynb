    "There are many types of clustering algorithms. Here are some of the most prominent examples of clustering algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Distribution-based methods: This is a clustering model in which we fit the data on the probability that how it may belong to the same distribution. The grouping done may be normal or Gaussian. Gaussian distribution is more prominent where we have a fixed number of distributions and all the upcoming data is fitted into it such that the distribution of data may get maximized. This model works well on synthetic data and diversely sized clusters. But this model may have problems if the constraints are not used to limit the modelâ€™s complexity. Furthermore, Distribution-based clustering produces clusters that assume concisely defined mathematical models underlying the data, a rather strong assumption for some data distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Centroid-based methods: This is basically one of the iterative clustering algorithms in which the clusters are formed by the closeness of data points to the centroid of clusters. Here, the cluster center i.e. centroid is formed such that the distance of data points is minimum with the center. This problem is basically one of the NP-Hard problems and thus solutions are commonly approximated over a number of trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Connectivity-based methods: The core idea of the connectivity-based model is similar to Centroid based model which is basically defining clusters on the basis of the closeness of data points. Here we work on a notion that the data points which are closer have similar behavior as compared to data points that are farther. It is not a single partitioning of the data set, instead, it provides an extensive hierarchy of clusters that merge with each other at certain distances. Here the choice of distance function is subjective.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Density Models: In this clustering model, there will be searching of data space for areas of varied density of data points in the data space. It isolates various density regions based on different densities present in the data space.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Subspace clustering: Subspace clustering is an unsupervised learning problem that aims at grouping data points into multiple clusters so that data points at a single cluster lie approximately on a low-dimensional linear subspace"
